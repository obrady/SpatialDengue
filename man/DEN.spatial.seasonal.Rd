\title{Run a single realisation of the spatial dengue model}
\usage{
DEN.spatial.seasonal(weekdates, fitdat, pastdat, unipix, pixdistmat, steprun,
      seasonal_vector, seasonal_start, paramsList = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{weekdates}{Two element vector of the start and end weeks of the simulation over which the model will be evaluated over}

\item{fitdat}{Data frame of the locations, numbers and timings (in weeks) of cases to fit the model to, see ?sgdat}

\item{pastdat}{Data frame of the locations, numbers and timings (in weeks) of all cases in the dataset (is used to generate the starting immunity profile), see ?sgdat}

\item{unipix}{Universal pixel lookup table, see ?make.unipix}

\item{pixdistmat}{A patch distance matrix, see example}

\item{steprun}{integer, number of days for which the simulation should run, excluding burn in period}

\item{seasonal_vector}{A vector of multipliers to change human-mosquito contact rate, each day of the year, to account for seasonality}

\item{seasonal_start}{Day in the year for the start of the model}

\item{paramsList}{Optional parameter list. If not supplied returns to defaults, see tutorial for full parameter list, see ?model.run for full list and explanation of parameters}
}
\description{
Main wrapper function for running a single realisation of the dengue spatial model, may take a while to run depending on specification
}
\details{
This function undertakes three main processes: i) fills in parameters with default options if not supplied, ii) generates a human movement matrix between patches,
ii) runs the model simulation.
within "paramsList()". Missing parameters will return to their default values. This function returns a outputs in a three element list giving:
i) daily counts of each model state (S, I, R, etc) sumed across the whole landscape, ii) daily counts of each model state for every patch,
iii) A treatment log (of length = number of steps) detailing which patches were treated each day
